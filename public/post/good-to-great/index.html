        <div class="my-4 content md:mx-16"><h2 id="who-we-are">Who we are</h2>
<p>We are a collaboration of non-government organisations and professionals working to ensure that government spending is done fairly, openly, efficiently, and creates the best value for money and best outcomes for Europe.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-advocate-for">What we advocate for</h2>
<p>We are working at the national and EU levels to advance the principles of openness in spending of funds, procurement, and company ownership within the EU.</p>
<h2 id="transparent-spending-of-eu-funds">Transparent spending of EU Funds:</h2>
<p>Disclosure requirements on the spending of EU funds are inadequate. This means that it is impossible to follow and monitor exactly how EU funds are being spent and who are the ultimate beneficiaries.</p>
<p>We push for full transparency on the spending of EU funds to allow for multi-stakeholder monitoring, currently prioritising the transparency of the Recovery and Resilience Facility fund. We urge Member States to release complete and open data on recipients of the EU funds so that civil society and investigative journalists have sufficient information to monitor spending.</p>
<h2 id="open-procurement">Open Procurement:</h2>
<p>The format and accessibility of public procurement data varies greatly across Europe. When data is provided, there are often problems with the structure and verification, which greatly hampers monitoring and analysis.</p>
<p>We advocate for user-friendly, accessible information across the entire procurement process by European governments from the planning, to the tender and award of contracts, to their delivery. We want governments to plan and deliver contracts involving relevant stakeholders throughout the process so that the best outcomes can be designed into public contracting from the start. We want procurement processes to be simple and user-friendly so that smaller businesses and entrepreneurs have a level playing field to compete.</p>
