      <description>In view of Russia&amp;rsquo;s military action against the Ukrainian people, being concerned about making sure that European funds are spent as effectively as possible and to monitor the activities of sanctioned individuals and their associates:
We call on the European Union and its member states to increase transparency and guarantee efficiency in the spending of public funds, We demand immediate action to increase the effective transparency of Beneficial and Company Ownership Registries. The European Union has shown in recent days its ability to take joint action to defend democracy and to stand up for the values that accompany it, demonstrating its collective strength. There are many challenges facing the public in relation to the current circumstances and how the situation in Ukraine and Europe will develop. We must make the EU even stronger and more resistant to corruption, to the misuse of its funds or to the penetration of its economy by sanctioned persons and institutions. One of the key tasks that must be implemented here and now is the creation of a comprehensive framework to ensure transparency and public control over the spending of EU funds, as well as full transparency of Beneficial and Company Ownership Registries. We must make sure that EU funds that reach countries outside and inside its borders are effective, meet the real needs of the recipients and protect them from irregularities in the distribution of these funds. Journalists and civil society organisations inside and outside the EU must have effective means to support the authorities and other institutions in tracing Russian capital.  We cannot allow ill-conceived privacy or economic interests to prevent this. The Union has put forward multiple Directives to make beneficial and company ownership more transparent, but in practice implementation at the EU and national level is falling short..
The strength of the Union is in acting together. We need a system that allows all willing civil society organisations, journalists, politicians and other officials to ensure that funds are spent efficiently, both to support EU citizens and those from other countries, and that those responsible for speaking out against democratic values cannot make profits on the EU territory.
We know how to make this happen. For a long time, we as a Coalition and its individual members have been pointing out the need to implement the following actions:
Proactive publication of information on national and EU level spending of funds: There should be mandatory proactive publication of information on spending, implementation and control of funds at national and EU level. All Member States and the European Commission should create an interoperable public portal where information on spending, implementation and control of EU funds spending is proactively published in open data and interoperable with other public datasets. User-friendly, accessible information across the entire procurement process by European governments from the planning, to the tender and award of contracts, to their delivery. We want governments to plan and deliver contracts involving relevant stakeholders throughout the process so that the best outcomes can be designed into public contracting from the start. Full publication of company ownership information under the Open Data Directive: The Implementing Act on high-value datasets under the Open Data Directive should require full and free publication of companies and company ownership information, under a genuinely open licence without additional restrictions. Full publication of beneficial ownership registers under the Anti-Money Laundering Directive: All Member States should comply with their obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering Directive and establish centralised, publicly accessible beneficial ownership registers for companies as soon as possible. Compulsory use of European Commission data-mining tool: All Member States should use the data-mining tool ARACHNE, which should be interoperable with other public datasets.
Although some of these tasks require changes in several regulations, they should be considered as components of a comprehensive system. Organisations dealing with transparency of expenditure, company, and beneficial ownership have the competence, and knowledge of practical solutions to achieve this. Politicians and other officials now have a special responsibility to put them into action.</description>

      <title>A Whitepaper on Opening up Recovery and Resilience Facility Spending</title>
      <link>http://open-spending.test/posts/rff_guidance_published/</link>

      <description>The Recovery and Resilience Facility is the largest contribution to Member States in the history of the European Union. Their aim is to support reforms, infrastructure and the improvement of the quality of life of millions of EU citizens. We all have a responsibility to ensure that it is spent transparently and for its intended purpose. At the same time, the regulations introducing the RRF at EU level have not guaranteed full openness of spending. For this reason the Open Spending EU Coalition has produced Guidance to show Member State governments what detailed information should be published about the spending of these funds. The Guidance can also be used by civil society organisations, journalists, and others who want to persuade their governments to be more transparent about how public money is spent. The Coalition will support such actions and will work towards their implementation. In the publication we also presented recommendations addressed to the European Commission. We believe that the best solution that supports openness of EU funds is centralised and transparent information about them.</description>

      <title>Open Spending EU Coalition Guidance on the Transparency of the RRF Spending</title>
      <link>http://open-spending.test/posts/guidance_rrf_transparency/</link>

      <description>Transparent and open RRF spending is attainable and realistic. To support the European Commission and Member States in establishing the right mechanisms for this, the Open Spending EU Coalition has come up with concrete, practical recommendations. These recommendations focus on exactly what should be published proactively, and how this information can be published to facilitate multi-stakeholder participation and monitoring.
Our guide is designed for all such scenarios, providing recommendations which can form the basis of a new open spending initiative and/or serve to inform strengthening of pre-existing transparency. The document is open to public consultations. We welcome any feedback by adding a comment in the text by 20th December 2021.</description>
